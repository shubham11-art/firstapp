// Project ch documentation - i.e konte modules use karnar, pratyekache kay features aahet etc

//**// Introduction
// Hello Sir/Mam, Good evening.I am shubham Gunjal and i have completed my bachelor of Engineering fron S. P.Pune University with aggrigation of 72%. I had started my carrier with Tech mahindra and working there since then. I have worked upon the technologies like ReactJS, Redux, JAvascript, HTml, CSS. I was working on Baker and Taylor project. Which is a web application that provides Web based library management service to public and academic libraries. Major services like management and distribution of Books, digital content and music labels along with services  like sales, manufacturing, warehousing, distribution for publishers. Like amazone kindle.

//*// Kaam kas chalayach
// Service - US based A follet company jyncha ha project aahe.
// Client used to tell the requirements, If requiement not met, tar Solve using stckoverflow, Youtube, senior developer.
// Data used to handle by Backend
// we were showing it.

//*// Precaution Taken
// Avoide hierarchy
// Placing files together
// Create sensible names - dont bother for length or nameOfComponent.

//*// Actual Folders
// src folder was Main Code Base
// Assets folder for - Images
// App folder - Store
// Features folder - For Admin and User
// APIs folder - In Which files for axios instance, endpoints
// Services Folder - for API calls (Backend la data pathavtana, konta data kontya dataType cha hawa he aadhich defined asat)
// Css - madhe universal css componet like bgcolor, margin, style, font etc in theme component. Component la css add karayachi asel tar class
// Auth Folder - Login/Sign up authintication/validation as per component -  With the help of Firebase otp, email, mobile varification.
// Shared folder -  for Routing related components/files , - 404 page, toast page - login successful, loding page - loader symbol
// Components Folder - In which Each component has a folder and, Each page/component related to that Parent component kept inside that one. Css related to that individual component/Page kept inside the same parent folder.
// Pages folder jyat page waale component aahet like HomePage, logout page etc

//**// Styling
// Inline styling pekshya, In seperate styles folder we have, styled components and we import them in the components and wrap our code with that component.
// Same way we have theme component for universal styling.
// Componets like - breakepoint, palette for colors, typohraphy.
// Themeprovider ne we wrap our App i.e whole component.
// const theme = createMuiTheme({
//     palette:{

//     }
// })
// mediaQueries - @media only screen and ()

//**// TechStack Used
// React version 16.8 madhe hooks aale aahet, i am working on 17.0.1 with hooks. Navin ka nahi use karat karan bug vaigare aahet tayt.
// CSS3
// HTML5
// ES6

//**// Work Needs to be done?
// Components konte banvale ani Kashe banavale astil? i.e functionality kay use keli aahe? - Yatach sangayach ki API call kele aahet. // Component banavale - Navbar, Navbar madhil naav, Resuable component banavale hote like header, footer. // Previous developement - he components banvale hote.? // Ata it is in maintainance phase Publisher, libraries i.e client provides Books we display it.

//**// Intro - project name, explain ki basic kamm kay aahe, o kya services provide karta hai along with domain of your project.
// 2nd - Explain ki Special features kya hai of the project. - 1)Crowd addressed form child to senior citizen 2) One stop destination for Readers and Publishers 3) Online Content 4) Book leasing 5) Online Tv to see comics for children
// 3rd - Impact of the Project - 1) Community literacy 2) Participation by all 3) Reach out to every length
// 4th - Techstack? - Which language, framework etc  - React, js, Html Css, Redux, Mterial UI
// 5th - Team - Your role? and others Role. ME and My collague - Ui design of components. Other - Sign up, login validation and payment related stuff.
// Why used perticular techStack only? - It was easy and compmay dependent.
// Difficulties you faced? and Tech Challenges? - Project has started with. They were using the class components, this keyword and its unmanagebility of the state. (Class components - Long time to run, this kew word, code complexity). Responsiveness becomes a challenge. Maintaing the state, acceessing the props and state becomes difficult.
// What are future improvements? - No App right now, They are planning for App with React Native.
// Flow of project? Project flow describes a preset sequence of activities required to plan, produce, deliver and maintain project product, along with information, materials, and resources required by the project // Execution wise. -  react ka  karan  UI intersrest- I. Agile method for info and requiement gathering. Use functional component, Fetch apis. About Project - Functional component ani tyach naav sangayache.
// MI kay kelay tar - Functional components like Reusable one - Header and footer and Cards, Other Components  like Library solution which has services like Book leasing, Overview, Weeding and Discarding. Routing and Fetch api call, Centralize state maintainace with redux store (persist storage through local memory var store kela to use it.)
// Other colluge used to do login, signup, subscription validation and authintication job. Admin Ui part.

// Learnings from the Project?
// High level design - Built? Deploy? CI/CD pipeline?- continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline for  a practice focused on improving software delivery throughout the software development life cycle via automation. By automating the process, the objective is to minimize human error and maintain a consistent process // YAML file working? asa Flow end to end i.e Functionally application kas kaam karat te.
// Ye used kiya, ye kyon nahi kiya? - Comoany dependent hai, not in my hand.
